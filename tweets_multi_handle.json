          "text": "Continuing the journey of optimal LLM-assisted coding experience. In particular, I find that instead of narrowing in on a perfect one thing my usage is increasingly diversifying across a few workflows that I \"stitch up\" the pros/cons of:\n\nPersonally the bread & butter (~75%?) of my LLM assistance continues to be just (Cursor) tab complete. This is because I find that writing concrete chunks of code/comments myself and in the right part of the code is a high bandwidth way of communicating \"task specification\" to the LLM, i.e. it's primarily about task specification bits - it takes too many bits and too much latency to communicate what I want in text, and it's faster to just demonstrate it in the code and in the right place. Sometimes the tab complete model is annoying so I toggle it on/off a lot.\n\nNext layer up is highlighting a concrete chunk of code and asking for some kind of a modification.\n\nNext layer up is Claude Code / Codex / etc, running on the side of Cursor, which I go to for larger chunks of functionality that are also fairly easy to specify in a prompt. These are super helpful, but still mixed overall and slightly frustrating at times. I don't run in YOLO mode because they can go off-track and do dumb things you didn't want/need and I ESC fairly often. I also haven't learned to be productive using more than one instance in parallel - one already feels hard enough. I haven't figured out a good way to keep CLAUDE[.]md good or up to date. I often have to do a pass of \"cleanups\" for coding style, or matters of code taste. E.g. they are too defensive and often over-use try/catch statements, they often over-complicate abstractions, they overbloat code (e.g. a nested if-the-else constructs when a list comprehension or a one-liner if-then-else would work), or they duplicate code chunks instead of creating a nice helper function, things like that... they basically don't have a sense of taste. They are indispensable in cases where I inch into a more vibe-coding territory where I'm less familiar (e.g. writing some rust recently, or sql commands, or anything else I've done less of before). I also tried CC to teach me things alongside the code it was writing but that didn't work at all - it really wants to just write code a lot more than it wants to explain anything along the way. I tried to get CC to do hyperparameter tuning, which was highly amusing. They are also super helpful in all kinds of lower-stakes one-off custom visualization or utilities or debugging code that I would never write otherwise because it would have taken way too long. E.g. CC can hammer out 1,000 lines of one-off extensive visualization/code just to identify a specific bug, which gets all deleted right after we find it. It's the code post-scarcity era - you can just create and then delete thousands of lines of super custom, super ephemeral code now, it's ok, it's not this precious costly thing anymore.\n\nFinal layer of defense is GPT5 Pro, which I go to for the hardest things. E.g. it has happened to me a few times now that I / Cursor / CC are all stuck on a bug for 10 minutes, but when I copy paste the whole thing to 5 Pro, it goes off for 10 minutes but then actually finds a really subtle bug. It is very strong. It can dig up all kinds of esoteric docs and papers and such. I've also used it for other meatier tasks, e.g. suggestions on how to clean up abstractions (mixed results, sometimes good ideas but not all), or an entire literature review around how people do this or that and it comes back with good relevant resources / pointers.\n\nAnyway, coding feels completely blown open with possibility across a number of \"kinds\" of coding and then a number of tools with their pros/cons. It's hard to avoid the feeling of anxiety around not being at the frontier of what is collectively possible, hence random sunday shower of thoughts and a good amount of curiosity about what others are finding.",

Video diffusion models (Veo and friends) are magic, but they take many seconds/minutes to generate. MirageLSD is real-time magic. Unlike simple video filters, diffusion models actually *understand* what they are looking at, so they can style all parts of the feed intelligently (e.g. putting hats on heads, or light sabers into hands, etc.). And they are arbitrarily steerable, e.g. by text prompts.\n\nCustomizable, intelligent video filters unlock many cool ideas over time:\n- transform camera feeds into alternate realities\n- direct and shoot your own movies, acting out scenes with props. Realtime => instant feedback/review.\n- vibe code games around just simple spheres/blocks, then use a real-time diffusion model to texture your game to make it beautiful.\n- style and customize any video feed: games, videos, ... e.g. Skyrim but \"MORE EPIC\"? DOOM II but modern Unreal Engine quality with just a prompt? Horror movie but \"cute, pink and bunnies only\"? I don't know!\n- zoom call backgrounds+++\n- real-time try on clothes virtually\n- glasses: e.g. cartoonify your vision in real time?\n- we can now build Harry Potter Mirror of Erised, showing the \"raw feed\" of you in the mirror but augmented with your deepest desires (as inferred by the AI).\n- I don't know, I'm probably missing the biggest one, so many things!\n\n(Disclosure I am (very small) angel investor in Decart, I was excited because imo this technology will get very good very fast and it feels general, powerful but it's also technically very difficult.

Other scientists have the same issue and have no time to read most of my lengthy conceptual papers either.  So whom are we writing these papers for?\n\nI guess, at least until they fall in to the same issue from their own work, AI's will be the only ones who actually have the bandwidth to read all this stuff.  I'm not specifically talking about today's language models - let's assume we mean whatever inevitable AI shows up, that is able to read the literature and have impact on the research (whether by talking to humans or by running lab automation/robot scientist platforms).\n\nSo then: how should we be writing, knowing that a lot of our audience will be AI (plus cyborgs, hybrots, augmented humans, etc.)?  Maybe it's too early to know what to do, but we better start thinking about it because assuming our audience will always be today's humans seems untenable. Taking seriously the idea that someday the impactful audience will be very different, and that the things we write now are in some sense a training set for truly diverse future beings, how does our writing change? or does it?\n\nwhat say you@danfaggella@mpshanahan@Plinz@blaiseaguera?",

Humanity has to continue to rise, become better alongside. Create something that is specifically designed to uplift team human. Definition intentionally left a bit vague to keep some entropy around people's interpretation, but imo examples include:\n- Any piece of software that aids explanation, visualization, memorization, inspiration, understanding, coordination, etc...\n- It doesn't have to be too lofty, e.g. it can be a specific educational article/video explaining something some other people could benefit from or that you have unique knowledge of.\n- Prompts/agents for explanation, e.g. along the lines of recently released ChatGPT study mode.\n- Related works of art\n\nThis challenge will run for 2 weeks until Aug 17th EOD PST. Submit your contribution as a reply. It has to be something that was uniquely created for this challenge and would not exist otherwise. Criteria includes execution, leverage, novelty, inspiration, aesthetics, amusement. People can upvote submissions by liking, this \"people's choice\" will also be a factor.

Video diffusion models (Veo and friends) are magic, but they take many seconds/minutes to generate. MirageLSD is real-time magic. Unlike simple video filters, diffusion models actually *understand* what they are looking at, so they can style all parts of the feed intelligently (e.g. putting hats on heads, or light sabers into hands, etc.). And they are arbitrarily steerable, e.g. by text prompts.\n\nCustomizable, intelligent video filters unlock many cool ideas over time:\n- transform camera feeds into alternate realities\n- direct and shoot your own movies, acting out scenes with props. Realtime => instant feedback/review.\n- vibe code games around just simple spheres/blocks, then use a real-time diffusion model to texture your game to make it beautiful.\n- style and customize any video feed: games, videos, ... e.g. Skyrim but \"MORE EPIC\"? DOOM II but modern Unreal Engine quality with just a prompt? Horror movie but \"cute, pink and bunnies only\"? I don't know!\n- zoom call backgrounds+++\n- real-time try on clothes virtually\n- glasses: e.g. cartoonify your vision in real time?\n- we can now build Harry Potter Mirror of Erised, showing the \"raw feed\" of you in the mirror but augmented with your deepest desires (as inferred by the AI).\n- I don't know, I'm probably missing the biggest one, so many things!\n\n(Disclosure I am (very small) angel investor in Decart, I was excited because imo this technology will get very good very fast and it feels general, powerful but it's also technically very difficult.

      "text": "Continuing the journey of optimal LLM-assisted coding experience. In particular, I find that instead of narrowing in on a perfect one thing my usage is increasingly diversifying across a few workflows that I \"stitch up\" the pros/cons of:\n\nPersonally the bread & butter (~75%?) of my LLM assistance continues to be just (Cursor) tab complete. This is because I find that writing concrete chunks of code/comments myself and in the right part of the code is a high bandwidth way of communicating \"task specification\" to the LLM, i.e. it's primarily about task specification bits - it takes too many bits and too much latency to communicate what I want in text, and it's faster to just demonstrate it in the code and in the right place. Sometimes the tab complete model is annoying so I toggle it on/off a lot.\n\nNext layer up is highlighting a concrete chunk of code and asking for some kind of a modification.\n\nNext layer up is Claude Code / Codex / etc, running on the side of Cursor, which I go to for larger chunks of functionality that are also fairly easy to specify in a prompt. These are super helpful, but still mixed overall and slightly frustrating at times. I don't run in YOLO mode because they can go off-track and do dumb things you didn't want/need and I ESC fairly often. I also haven't learned to be productive using more than one instance in parallel - one already feels hard enough. I haven't figured out a good way to keep CLAUDE[.]md good or up to date. I often have to do a pass of \"cleanups\" for coding style, or matters of code taste. E.g. they are too defensive and often over-use try/catch statements, they often over-complicate abstractions, they overbloat code (e.g. a nested if-the-else constructs when a list comprehension or a one-liner if-then-else would work), or they duplicate code chunks instead of creating a nice helper function, things like that... they basically don't have a sense of taste. They are indispensable in cases where I inch into a more vibe-coding territory where I'm less familiar (e.g. writing some rust recently, or sql commands, or anything else I've done less of before). I also tried CC to teach me things alongside the code it was writing but that didn't work at all - it really wants to just write code a lot more than it wants to explain anything along the way. I tried to get CC to do hyperparameter tuning, which was highly amusing. They are also super helpful in all kinds of lower-stakes one-off custom visualization or utilities or debugging code that I would never write otherwise because it would have taken way too long. E.g. CC can hammer out 1,000 lines of one-off extensive visualization/code just to identify a specific bug, which gets all deleted right after we find it. It's the code post-scarcity era - you can just create and then delete thousands of lines of super custom, super ephemeral code now, it's ok, it's not this precious costly thing anymore.\n\nFinal layer of defense is GPT5 Pro, which I go to for the hardest things. E.g. it has happened to me a few times now that I / Cursor / CC are all stuck on a bug for 10 minutes, but when I copy paste the whole thing to 5 Pro, it goes off for 10 minutes but then actually finds a really subtle bug. It is very strong. It can dig up all kinds of esoteric docs and papers and such. I've also used it for other meatier tasks, e.g. suggestions on how to clean up abstractions (mixed results, sometimes good ideas but not all), or an entire literature review around how people do this or that and it comes back with good relevant resources / pointers.\n\nAnyway, coding feels completely blown open with possibility across a number of \"kinds\" of coding and then a number of tools with their pros/cons. It's hard to avoid the feeling of anxiety around not being at the frontier of what is collectively possible, hence random sunday shower of thoughts and a good amount of curiosity about what others are finding.",

Other scientists have the same issue and have no time to read most of my lengthy conceptual papers either.  So whom are we writing these papers for?\n\nI guess, at least until they fall in to the same issue from their own work, AI's will be the only ones who actually have the bandwidth to read all this stuff.  I'm not specifically talking about today's language models - let's assume we mean whatever inevitable AI shows up, that is able to read the literature and have impact on the research (whether by talking to humans or by running lab automation/robot scientist platforms).\n\nSo then: how should we be writing, knowing that a lot of our audience will be AI (plus cyborgs, hybrots, augmented humans, etc.)?  Maybe it's too early to know what to do, but we better start thinking about it because assuming our audience will always be today's humans seems untenable. Taking seriously the idea that someday the impactful audience will be very different, and that the things we write now are in some sense a training set for truly diverse future beings, how does our writing change? or does it?\n\nwhat say you@danfaggella@mpshanahan@Plinz@blaiseaguera?",
